# Snowdog Front-end Recruitment test

Test is based on [Google Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) v0.6.5

### Task 1
Fork this repository. Remember to commit changes after every task (if necessary).

### Task 2
Follow Google Web Starter Kit ["instalation instructions"](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/install.md). Then you will see test page on http://localhost:3000/

### Task 3
Add [this repo](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/front-end-recruitment-test-submodule) as submodule at `/submodule` folder, then run gulp task `submodule`, to add symlink. [Here](http://localhost:3000/submodule.html) you will see beautiful page with slices of fried bacon.

Now you should write JS to clone bacon image and attach this action to **Yeah, I want more bacon!** button.

### Task 4
Back to main repo and add another tab - **Checkout**. Project is in `/projects/checkout.png` - make this tab as similar to project as you can. Use SCSS to write your styles.

### Task 5
Add simple JS validation to checkout form created earlier. Remember to show success/error message on form submit.
